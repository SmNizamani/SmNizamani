# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Shah Muhammad!

I'm a dedicated software tester with a keen eye for detail and a strong background in both manual and automation testing. My journey in software testing has been both challenging and rewarding, as I continuously strive to ensure the highest quality of software products.

## ðŸ’¼ What I Do

- **Manual Testing**: Ensuring that the user experience is flawless by meticulously testing applications across various scenarios.
- **Automation Testing**: Developing robust automated test scripts using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) to streamline the testing process and catch bugs early.

## ðŸ”§ Skills & Tools

- **Manual Testing**: Exploratory testing, test case creation, bug reporting, and regression testing.
- **Automation Tools**: Playwright, Cucumber, Selenium.
- **Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python (for test automation scripting).
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub.
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions.

## ðŸŒ± What I'm Learning

- Deepening my knowledge of **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** methodologies.
- Exploring advanced features of Playwright and Cucumber to enhance test automation frameworks.
- Keeping up with the latest trends in **DevOps** and **Continuous Testing**.

## ðŸš€ My Projects

- **[Automation Testing with Playwright & Cucumber](https://github.com/SmNizamani/lambda-ecommerce)**: A collection of test automation scripts demonstrating the use of Playwright and Cucumber in real-world scenarios.

## âœ¨ Fun Facts

- I love turning complex test scenarios into simple, automated scripts that run smoothly! ðŸ§©
- I'm a big advocate of **quality over quantity** when it comes to testing. ðŸš¦
- When I'm not testing, you can find me reading up on the latest in tech or playing video games. ðŸŽ®

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to check out my repositories and reach out if you'd like to collaborate. Let's build something amazing together! ðŸš€
